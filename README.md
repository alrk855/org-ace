## SPA Hosting

Since this is a single-page application (SPA) using client-side routing, you'll need to configure your host to redirect all requests to `index.html`.

### Netlify

Create `netlify.toml`:
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### Nginx

```nginx
location / {
  try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```

### Apache

Create `.htaccess`:
```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
```
